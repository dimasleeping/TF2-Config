My personal configuration for Team Fortress 2 in 2022. The first appearance on the network on January 25, 2022. The configuration is being actively updated.

# How to install
1. Install files from the folder: "if mastercomfig not installed", if you do not have mastercomfig installed.
/ or install the files from the folder: "if mastecomfig is installed", if you have installed mastecomfig.

2. Go to the root folder of the game.
